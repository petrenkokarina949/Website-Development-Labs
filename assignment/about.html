        <p> My name is Karina Petrenko. I am a first-year student. I am studying Software System Development at SETU.
             I am from Ukraine. Before the full-scale war began, I lived in the large Ukrainian city of Chernihiv.
              But the idea behind this website is not to talk about my life, but to talk about my hobby. </p>

<p>Since I was a teenager, I have enjoyed creating beautiful things with my own hands. While I was living in Ukraine,
     I loved embroidering pictures with beads and painting by numbers. But it takes a lot of time because it takes about
      three months to embroider one large picture.</p>

<p>So when I moved, I started looking for a new hobby, as I no longer had that much free time. And thanks to TikTok, I found it. 
    My new hobby is weaving beaded jewelry.</p>

<p>I quickly learned how to create beautiful patterns on jewelry. I found the right beads, needles, and threads, 
    even though I have to order the materials from Ukraine, but I am confident in the quality of my jewelry. 
    At the bottom of this page, I have added a table with the materials I use myself, which you may find useful.</p>
    <table>

<p>At first, I only made jewelry for my friends and acquaintances, but then I was invited to participate in a fair. 
    From that moment on, I started making jewelry to order. Now I can not only make jewelry according to a ready-made pattern,
     but also create a pattern that the buyer wants.  </p> 
     <p>So I would like to present to you <a href="gallery.html">a gallery</a> of my best works.</p>
